- To test the functionality of version2.py, create a new virtual environment with the dependencies as stated in ```requirements2.txt```
- Note: For both .py files, you will need to manually run ```pip commands``` in the terminal, in additional to running the usual ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip install -r requirements2.txt```
